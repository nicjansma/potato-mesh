## Web App

Requires Ruby for the Sinatra web app and SQLite3 for the app's database.

```bash
pacman -S ruby sqlite3
gem install sinatra sqlite3 rackup puma rspec rack-test rufo prometheus-client
cd ./web
bundle install
```

### Run

Check out the `app.sh` run script in `./web` directory.

```bash
API_TOKEN="1eb140fd-cab4-40be-b862-41c607762246" ./app.sh
== Sinatra (v4.1.1) has taken the stage on 41447 for development with backup from Puma
Puma starting in single mode...
[...]
*  Environment: development
*          PID: 188487
* Listening on http://127.0.0.1:41447
```

Check [127.0.0.1:41447](http://127.0.0.1:41447/) for the development preview
of the node map. Set `API_TOKEN` required for authorizations on the API's POST endpoints.

### Production

When promoting the app to production, run the server with the minimum required
configuration to ensure secure access and proper routing:

```bash
RACK_ENV="production" \
APP_ENV="production" \
API_TOKEN="SuperSecureTokenReally" \
INSTANCE_DOMAIN="https://potatomesh.net" \
MAP_CENTER="53.55,13.42" \
exec ruby app.rb -p 41447 -o 0.0.0.0
```

* `RACK_ENV` and `APP_ENV` must be set to `production` to enable optimized
  settings suited for live deployments.
* Bind the server to a production port and all interfaces (`-p 41447 -o 0.0.0.0`)
  so that clients can reach the dashboard over the network.
* Provide a strong `API_TOKEN` value to authorize POST requests against the API.
* Configure `INSTANCE_DOMAIN` with the public URL of your deployment so vanity
  links and generated metadata resolve correctly.
* Don't forget to set a `MAP_CENTER` to point to your local region.

The web app can be configured with environment variables (defaults shown):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_TOKEN` | _required_ | Shared secret that authorizes ingestors and API clients making `POST` requests. |
| `INSTANCE_DOMAIN` | _auto-detected_ | Public hostname (optionally with port) used for metadata, federation, and generated API links. |
| `SITE_NAME` | `"PotatoMesh Demo"` | Title and header displayed in the UI. |
| `MESHTASTIC_PRESET` | `"#LongFast"` | Meshtastic radio preset shown in the join strip, meta description, and federation directory (e.g. `MediumFast`). |
| `MESHTASTIC_FREQ` | `"915MHz"` | Meshtastic frequency shown alongside the preset. |
| `MESHCORE_PRESET` | _unset_ | Meshcore radio preset for the join strip; the Meshcore line is hidden until both `MESHCORE_*` values are set. |
| `MESHCORE_FREQ` | _unset_ | Meshcore frequency for the join strip. |
| `CONTACT_LINK` | `"#potatomesh:dod.ngo"` | Chat link or Matrix alias rendered in the footer and overlays. |
| `ANNOUNCEMENT` | _unset_ | Optional announcement banner text rendered above the header on every page. |
| `MAP_CENTER` | `38.761944,-27.090833` | Latitude and longitude that centre the map on load. |
| `MAP_ZOOM` | _unset_ | Fixed Leaflet zoom applied on first load; disables auto-fit when provided. |
| `MAX_DISTANCE` | `42` | Maximum distance (km) before node relationships are hidden on the map. |
| `DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` for verbose logging in the web services. |
| `FEDERATION` | `1` | Set to `1` to announce your instance and crawl peers, or `0` to disable federation. Private mode overrides this. |
| `PRIVATE` | `0` | Set to `1` to hide the chat UI, disable message APIs, and exclude hidden clients from public listings. |
| `EVENTS` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable the live-update SSE stream (`GET /api/events`); clients then fall back to polling at the refresh interval. |
| `MIN_THREADS` | `16` | Minimum Puma worker threads kept warm. |
| `MAX_THREADS` | `96` | Maximum Puma worker threads. Each active `/api/events` SSE stream pins one thread, so keep this above your peak concurrent SSE clients plus API/ingest headroom. |
| `OG_IMAGE_URL` | _unset_ | Optional absolute URL for the social preview image. Must use an `http://` or `https://` scheme; values with other schemes are ignored. Most social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, iMessage) require **HTTPS** to render the card. When set, replaces the runtime-generated `/og-image.png` so deployments without Chromium (or with size-conscious images) can point at a CDN. |
| `PAGES_DIR` | `./pages` | The directory for static, custom-content pages. |
| `PROM_REPORT_IDS` | _unset_ | Comma-separated node ids to expose as per-node Prometheus gauges. Empty exports none. |
| `TELEMETRY_REQUESTS` | `0` | Set `1` to show a "Request telemetry" button on MeshCore nodes; the ingestor only transmits if it runs with `TX_ENABLED=1`. |
| `TELEMETRY_REQUEST_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `900` | Seconds before the same node can be requested again; values under 300 are raised to 300. |
| `TELEMETRY_REQUEST_HOURLY_CAP` | `12` | Accepted requests per hour across all nodes; `0` disables accepting requests. |

The application derives SEO-friendly document titles, descriptions, and social
preview tags from these existing configuration values. `/robots.txt` and
`/sitemap.xml` are generated automatically and respect `PRIVATE`/`FEDERATION`
toggles; markdown files in `pages/` may declare optional YAML frontmatter
(`title`, `description`, `image`, `noindex`) for per-page overrides. The
`image:` frontmatter must be an absolute `http(s)://` URL; other schemes are
silently dropped to keep operators from accidentally leaking `data:` or
`javascript:` URIs into Open Graph tags.

If `INSTANCE_DOMAIN` is unset in production the app emits a one-time `WARN`
at startup; canonical URLs and sitemap entries fall back to the inbound
`Host` header, which can be cache-poisoned by a misconfigured proxy. Set
`INSTANCE_DOMAIN` to your public hostname to silence the warning.

Example:

```bash
SITE_NAME="PotatoMesh Demo" INSTANCE_DOMAIN="https://potatomesh.net" MAP_CENTER=38.761944,-27.090833 MAP_ZOOM=11 MAX_DISTANCE=42 CONTACT_LINK="#potatomesh:dod.ngo" ./app.sh
```

### Configuration & Storage

PotatoMesh stores its runtime assets using the XDG base directory specification.
When XDG directories are not provided the application falls back
to the repository root.

The key is written to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/potato-mesh/keyfile` and the
well-known document is staged in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/potato-mesh/well-known/potato-mesh`.

The database can be found in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/potato-mesh`.

**Outbound requests.** The map requests basemap tiles from two third-party CDNs
on every viewport — OpenStreetMap HOT (`tile.openstreetmap.fr`) and CARTO
(`basemaps.cartocdn.com`) — so a visitor's browser contacts both. Only `z/x/y`
tile coordinates are sent: no API key, token, cookie, or analytics parameter.
Tiles are the only third-party request the dashboard makes.

### Custom Pages

Instance operators can publish static content pages (contact details, mesh
protocol information, legal notices, etc.) by placing Markdown files in the
`pages/` directory inside `web/`. Each `.md` file automatically becomes a nav
entry and a route under `/pages/<slug>`.

Files are named `<sort-prefix>-<slug>.md`: the numeric prefix controls
navigation order and the slug becomes the URL path and nav label:

| Filename               | Nav Label      | URL                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `1-about.md`           | About          | `/pages/about`          |
| `5-rules.md`           | Rules          | `/pages/rules`          |
| `9-contact.md`         | Contact        | `/pages/contact`        |
| `20-impressum.md`      | Impressum      | `/pages/impressum`      |

A default `1-about.md` ships with the app. In Docker deployments the directory
is exposed as the `potatomesh_pages` volume (mounted at `/app/pages`) so you can
add or edit pages without rebuilding the image. The pages directory can also be
overridden with the `PAGES_DIR` environment variable.

### Federation

PotatoMesh instances can optionally federate by publishing signed metadata and
discovering peers. Federation is enabled by default and controlled with the
`FEDERATION` environment variable. Set `FEDERATION=1` (default) to announce your
instance, respond to remote crawlers, and crawl the wider network. Set
`FEDERATION=0` to keep your deployment isolated. Private mode still takes
precedence; when `PRIVATE=1`, federation features remain disabled regardless of
the `FEDERATION` value.

When federation is enabled, PotatoMesh automatically refreshes entries from
known peers every eight hours to keep the directory current. Instances that
stop responding are considered stale and are removed from the web frontend after
72 hours, ensuring visitors only see active deployments in the public
directory.

### API

All `GET` routes accept `?limit=` and `?since=`; bulk collections also accept
`?before=` and `?protocol=`. All `POST` routes require
`Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`.

**Collections** — `GET` list, `GET /:id` for one node's rows, `POST` to ingest:

| Path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/nodes` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST` |
| `/api/positions` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST` |
| `/api/telemetry` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST`; `/api/telemetry/aggregated` for rollups |
| `/api/messages` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST`; all 404 when `PRIVATE=1` |
| `/api/neighbors` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST` |
| `/api/traces` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST` |
| `/api/waypoints` | `GET`, `GET /:id`, `POST`; all 404 when `PRIVATE=1` |
| `/api/destinations` | `GET`; `?node_id=` filters. Reticulum destinations per node |
| `/api/ingestors` | `GET`, `POST`. Active ingestors feeding this instance |
| `/api/instances` | `GET`, `POST`. Known federated instances |

**Other**

| Path | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/stats` | Node/message/telemetry counts per protocol and window |
| `GET /api/stats/activity` | Packets/hour time series per protocol |
| `GET /api/events` | SSE stream of collection-change events |

custom pages. Static assets: `GET /favicon.ico`, `GET /potatomesh-logo.svg`.

There is no health endpoint; use `GET /version`.

### Advanced tuning

Environment variables for the web app's internals. All optional; set only to
change the defaults shown. Not pre-declared in `.env.example`, Compose, or the
NixOS module — set them in the environment of the web process.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `MIN_THREADS` | `16` | Puma minimum thread count. |
| `MAX_THREADS` | `96` | Puma maximum thread count. |

### Monitoring

PotatoMesh ships with a Prometheus exporter mounted at `/metrics`. Consult
[`PROMETHEUS.md`](./PROMETHEUS.md) for deployment guidance, metric details, and
scrape configuration examples.

## Ingestor

The web app is not meant to be run locally connected to a LoRa node but rather
on a remote host without access to a physical LoRa device. Therefore, it only
accepts data through the API POST endpoints. Benefit is, here _multiple nodes across the
community_ can feed the dashboard with data. The web app handles messages and nodes
by ID and there will be no duplication.

For convenience, the directory `./data` contains a Python ingestor. It connects to a
LoRa node via serial port or to a remote device that exposes the LoRa TCP
or Bluetooth (BLE) interfaces to gather nodes and messages seen by the node.

```bash
pacman -S python
cd ./data
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r "requirements.txt
```

It uses the respective Python library to ingest mesh data and post nodes and messages
to the configured potato-mesh instance.

Check out `mesh.sh` ingestor script in the `./data` directory.

```bash
INSTANCE_DOMAIN=http://127.0.0.1:41447 API_TOKEN=1eb140fd-cab4-40be-b862-41c607762246 CONNECTION=/dev/ttyACM0 DEBUG=1 ./mesh.sh
[2025-02-20T12:34:56.789012Z] [potato-mesh] [info] channel=0 context=daemon.main port='41447' target='http://127.0.0.1' Mesh daemon starting

[2025-02-20T12:34:57.456789Z] [potato-mesh] [debug] context=handlers.upsert_node node_id=!ba653ae8 short_name='3ae8' long_name='3ae8' Queued node upsert payload

```

Run the script with `INSTANCE_DOMAIN` and `API_TOKEN` to keep updating
node records and parsing new incoming messages. Enable debug output with `DEBUG=1`,
specify the connection target with `CONNECTION` (default `/dev/ttyACM0`) or set it to
an IP address (for example `192.168.1.20:4403`) to use the Meshtastic TCP
interface. `CONNECTION` also accepts Bluetooth device addresses in MAC format (e.g.,
`ED:4D:9E:95:CF:60`) or UUID format for macOS (e.g., `C0AEA92F-045E-9B82-C9A6-A1FD822B3A9E`)
and the script attempts a BLE connection if available. To keep
ingestion limited, set `ALLOWED_CHANNELS` to a comma-separated whitelist (for
example `ALLOWED_CHANNELS="Chat,Ops"`); packets on other channels are discarded.
Use `HIDDEN_CHANNELS` to block specific channels from the web UI even when they
appear in the allowlist.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_TOKEN` | _required_ | Shared secret that authorizes ingestors and API clients making `POST` requests. |
| `INSTANCE_DOMAIN` | _required_ | Public hostname (optionally with port) used for feeding the API with data. |
| `PROTOCOL` | `meshtastic` | Which protocol are we ingesting? One of `meshtastic`, `meshcore`, or `reticulum`. |
| `CONNECTION` | `/dev/ttyACM0` | Where do we talk to the node? Accepts serial ports, TCP connections, and bluetooth addresses (BLE mac). Ignored under `PROTOCOL=reticulum`, which has no single endpoint — see [Reticulum](#reticulum). |
| `DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` for verbose logging in the ingestor services. |
| `CHANNEL_INDEX` | `0` | Which channel index to ingest from. |
| `ENERGY_SAVING` | `0` | Set to `1` to duty-cycle the radio connection instead of holding it open. |
| `FREQUENCY` | _unset_ | Deprecated alias for `MESHTASTIC_FREQ`; overrides the auto-detected LoRa frequency. |
| `CHANNEL` | _unset_ | Deprecated alias for `MESHTASTIC_PRESET`. |
| `ALLOWED_CHANNELS` | _unset_ | Comma-separated channel names the ingestor accepts; when set, all other channels are skipped before hidden filters. |
| `HIDDEN_CHANNELS` | _unset_ | Comma-separated channel names the ingestor will ignore when forwarding packets. |
| `TRANSPORT` | `api` | Ingestor transport: `api` (Meshtastic library over serial/TCP/BLE) or `udp` (passive LAN multicast; see [Passive UDP transport](#passive-udp-transport)). |
| `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_ONLY` | `0` | Set to `1` to ingest only the primary channel (index 0) and drop all other channels. In UDP transport this requires `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_NAME`; without it, every packet is dropped (fail closed). |
| `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_KEY` | `AQ==` | Base64 PSK used to decrypt the primary channel in UDP transport (default = Meshtastic default key). |
| `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_NAME` | _unset_ | Name of channel 0 (e.g. `MediumFast`/`LongFast`: the preset name the firmware uses when the channel name is blank, as shown by `meshtastic --info`). Used to compute the channel hash that identifies primary traffic on the UDP multicast. Required by UDP `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_ONLY=1`, because a secondary channel can share the default `AQ==` key: only the per-channel hash of *(name, key)* distinguishes them. |
| `MESH_UDP_GROUP` | `224.0.0.69` | Multicast group joined in UDP transport. |
| `MESH_UDP_PORT` | `4403` | Multicast port joined in UDP transport. |
| `INGESTOR_NODE_ID` | _unset_ | `!xxxxxxxx` id used for the ingestor heartbeat. Required for the UDP transport, which cannot auto-detect "self". Optional for `PROTOCOL=reticulum`, which derives one from your primary announced identity; set it there only to override that. |
| `RETICULUM_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.reticulum` | Which RNS config the ingestor uses, and so which interfaces it can see. Point it at the directory your `rnsd` uses. See [Reticulum](#reticulum). |
| `RETICULUM_FREQ` | _from RNS config_ | Frequency shown for Reticulum nodes. Overrides the value read from your `RNodeInterface` section. |
| `RETICULUM_PRESET` | _from RNS config_ | Radio preset shown for Reticulum nodes. Overrides the value derived from your bandwidth/spreading-factor/coding-rate. |
| `RETICULUM_INTERFACES` | _unset_ | Which RNS interfaces to ingest from, e.g. `RNode`. Comma-separated, case-insensitive substring match against the names in `rnstatus`. Your own nodes are always ingested; empty ingests everything. See [Reticulum](#reticulum). |
| `MESHCORE_TELEMETRY_POLL_SECONDS` | `300` | Requires `TX_ENABLED=1` (polling other nodes is a transmission). Seconds between Meshcore contact telemetry polls (one on-air request per interval, round-robin over the roster; each contact is additionally polled at most once per 24 h: when every contact is fresh the tick sends nothing). Set `0` to disable on-air polling. |
| `MESHCORE_SELF_TELEMETRY_SECONDS` | `3600` | Seconds between Meshcore host self-telemetry reads (battery/sensors over the companion link, no airtime). Set `0` to disable. |
| `TX_ENABLED` | `0` | Master switch for everything the ingestor puts on the air Off by default: the ingestor is a listener. Set to `1` to allow transmitting; this is what enables Meshcore on-air contact telemetry polling. Does not by itself enable announcements. See [Transmitting on the mesh](#transmitting-on-the-mesh). |
| `TX_ANNOUNCE` | `0` | Set to `1` (with `TX_ENABLED=1`) to broadcast a one-line activity summary on the default channel: at most once per 24 h, never in the first 24 h after start. Off by default: it is unsolicited automated traffic on a channel people read. See [Transmitting on the mesh](#transmitting-on-the-mesh). |

### Transmitting on the mesh

By default a PotatoMesh ingestor never transmits. It listens, and forwards
what it hears to your dashboard. Nothing below happens unless you turn it on.

| Variable | Default | What turning it on means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TX_ENABLED` | `0` | The ingestor may transmit. On its own this enables Meshcore on-air telemetry polling: round-robin requests to other nodes for their battery/sensor readings, at most one request per `MESHCORE_TELEMETRY_POLL_SECONDS` (default 300 s) and at most once per 24 h per node. This is how other nodes' telemetry reaches your dashboard. Meshtastic ingestion needs no transmission at all. |
| `TX_ANNOUNCE` | `0` | Requires `TX_ENABLED=1`. Broadcasts one line on your default channel, at most once every 24 h, and never in the first 24 h after the ingestor starts. |

The announcement looks like this:

```
Meshtastic activity in the last 24h: 42 active nodes, 118 packets/hour. https://mesh.example.org
```

The numbers come from your instance's public API, covering the whole mesh your
dashboard sees. Announcements are suppressed when the instance runs `PRIVATE=1`,
and the check fails closed: if the ingestor cannot reach the instance to ask, it
does not transmit.

Both flags must be on for an announcement to go out:

| `TX_ENABLED` | `TX_ANNOUNCE` | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `0` | Receive only. The default. |
| `0` | `1` | Receive only: `TX_ENABLED=0` wins. |
| `1` | `0` | Telemetry polling on, no announcements. |
| `1` | `1` | Telemetry polling on, one announcement per 24 h. |


The ingestor logs the resolved policy at startup, without `DEBUG=1`:

```
[2026-08-24T09:12:44.117Z] [potato-mesh] [info] context=tx.policy announcements_permitted=False rx_only=False transmit_permitted=False tx_announce=False tx_enabled=False Transmit policy resolved
```

If a flag seems to have no effect, that line shows what the ingestor actually
resolved — including a flag that never reached the container.

### Meshcore

Set `PROTOCOL=meshcore` to ingest from a Meshcore companion-firmware node
instead (serial, TCP, or BLE via the same `CONNECTION` formats). Alongside
contacts and messages, the ingestor captures RF metrics: per-message SNR and
hop counts, per-channel-message RSSI and repeater path (decoded from the
radio's RX log), and per-advert SNR/RSSI/hops for every node heard on air:
including nodes the radio's contact roster has no room for.

Note: the ingestor writes one radio setting. At startup it enables the
firmware's *overwrite-oldest-contact* flag (`autoadd_config` bit `0x01`,
firmware ≥ 1.16) so a full contact roster evicts its oldest non-favourite
entry instead of rejecting new nodes. The write happens only when the bit is
not already set, preserves all other auto-add settings, persists on the
device, and never evicts favourites. Older firmware without the command is
left untouched. Evicted contacts remain in the dashboard's database: only
the radio's local roster rotates.

### Reticulum

Set `PROTOCOL=reticulum` to ingest from a Reticulum (RNS) network. The ingestor
listens for announces and files each one as a node. It never transmits, so
`TX_ENABLED=0` (the default) is fine.

`CONNECTION` does not apply; if it is set the ingestor ignores it and logs that
it did.

It reads your existing `~/.reticulum`, so if `rnsd` already works, so does this:

```bash
API_TOKEN=... INSTANCE_DOMAIN=https://your.instance PROTOCOL=reticulum ./data/mesh.sh
```

**To ingest only from your radio**, set `RETICULUM_INTERFACES` to part of the
interface name from `rnstatus` — matching is case-insensitive substring:

```bash
RETICULUM_INTERFACES="RNode Reticulum Berlin"
```

Your own nodes are always ingested regardless of this setting. Everything
further away is filtered by it.

**To use a different RNS config**, set `RETICULUM_CONFIG_DIR`. Point it at the
same directory your `rnsd` uses — interface filtering asks that instance which
interface an announce came in on, and the request is rejected across directories.

**In Docker**, the config dir is the `potatomesh_reticulum` volume, mounted at
`/app/.config/potato-mesh/reticulum`. RNS writes its stock config there on first
start, whose only interface is a link-local `AutoInterface`:

- On the default bridge network that interface reaches no radio and usually no
  peers, so the ingestor connects and hears nothing.
- Add your interfaces to the volume's `config` file, then restart the ingestor:
  `docker compose exec ingestor sh -c 'cat >> /app/.config/potato-mesh/reticulum/config'`
- Or point `RETICULUM_CONFIG_DIR` at a bind mount of the host's `~/.reticulum`
  and run the container with host networking.

The ingestor derives its own node id from your **primary identity** — the one
announcing the most destinations on this machine, which is the identity your
LXMF and nomadnet addresses belong to. `INGESTOR_NODE_ID` overrides it.

It reports the id it resolved at startup:

```
context=reticulum.connect ... node_id='!27716218' Reticulum announce listener registered
```

`node_id='pending'` means nothing local has been heard yet; the ingestor retries
each loop and logs again once it resolves. It is **not** the transport identity,
and not the hash `rnstatus` prints as "Transport Instance".

**Changing the id strands the old row.** Setting, changing, or removing
`INGESTOR_NODE_ID` moves the ingestor's node id; the previous row stays in
`/api/ingestors` without heartbeats until it ages out. Leaving the variable
as-is across upgrades is inert.

**Frequency and preset** are read from the first `RNodeInterface` in your RNS
config; `RETICULUM_FREQ` and `RETICULUM_PRESET` override them. A preset whose
bandwidth, spreading factor and coding rate match a Meshtastic preset shows that
name — it describes the radio settings, not compatibility with a Meshtastic
mesh — otherwise it shows `SF8/BW125/CR5`.

The values are read once at startup. Change them in the RNS config and restart
the ingestor, or the dashboard keeps showing the old ones.

A node appears once per announced destination, so one peer running LXMF and a
nomadnet node shows up as two entries. `GET /api/destinations` lists them and
groups them by identity.

Announces carry no SNR, battery, or position, so those columns show dashes and
Reticulum nodes stay off the map.

### Passive UDP transport

The Meshtastic node radio accepts only one API client at a time (serial or
TCP), so an ingestor connected over `CONNECTION` monopolizes the node: the
phone app, CLI, and message sending fight it for the single slot. Setting
`TRANSPORT=udp` switches the ingestor to a passive listener that never
connects to the node's API at all: it joins the node's LAN multicast group
(Meshtastic "Mesh via UDP", `224.0.0.69:4403`) and decodes packets off the wire,
leaving the node's API slot completely free.

Enable "Mesh via UDP" on the node first (`meshtastic --set
network.enabled_protocols 1`). The ingestor decrypts the primary channel with
`PRIMARY_CHANNEL_KEY` (the Meshtastic default key `AQ==` by default). Private
channels with their own secret keys are cryptographically unreadable and
dropped. To guarantee only channel 0 is ingested, set
`PRIMARY_CHANNEL_ONLY=1` and `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_NAME` (e.g. `MediumFast`): each
packet advertises the hash of its channel *(name + key)*, and only packets whose
hash matches the primary channel's are accepted. This is stricter than decrypting
with the primary key: a secondary channel created with the default `AQ==` key
would decrypt too, but has a different name and therefore a different hash, so it
is dropped. If `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_NAME` is not set while `PRIMARY_CHANNEL_ONLY=1`,
the ingestor fails closed and drops everything. Because there is no API
connection, the node's bulk node database is not read: the node list rebuilds
over the air from observed packets, and payloads (position, telemetry,
traceroute, …) are decoded into the exact same shape the API/serial transport
produces, so the collector receives identical records.

`TRANSPORT=udp` requires host networking so the container can receive LAN
multicast (`network_mode: host`). A ready-to-use Raspberry Pi (arm64) deployment
is provided in [`data/tools/compose.udp.pi.yml`](data/tools/compose.udp.pi.yml).
Capture live packets for testing with
[`data/tools/capture_udp_fixtures.py`](data/tools/capture_udp_fixtures.py).

## Nix

For the dev shell, run:

```bash
nix develop
```

The shell provides Ruby plus the Python ingestor dependencies (including `meshtastic`
and `protobuf`). To sanity-check that the ingestor starts, run `python -m data.mesh`
with the usual environment variables (`INSTANCE_DOMAIN`, `API_TOKEN`, `CONNECTION`).

To run the packaged apps directly:

```bash
nix run .#web
nix run .#ingestor
```

Minimal NixOS module snippet:

```nix
services.potato-mesh = {
  enable = true;
  apiTokenFile = config.sops.secrets.potato-mesh-api-token.path;
  dataDir = "/var/lib/potato-mesh";
  port = 41447;
  instanceDomain = "https://mesh.me";
  siteName = "Nix Mesh";
  contactLink = "homeserver.mx";
  mapCenter = "28.96,-13.56";
  frequency = "868MHz";
  ingestor = {
    enable = true;
    connection = "192.168.X.Y:4403";
  };
};
```

Every variable in the tables above has a module option, named in camelCase
(`SITE_NAME` → `siteName`, `OG_IMAGE_URL` → `ogImageUrl`):

- Web options sit at the top level; ingestor options sit under `ingestor`.
- `PROTOCOL`, `TRANSPORT`, `INGESTOR_NODE_ID` → `ingestor.protocol`,
  `ingestor.transport`, `ingestor.nodeId`.
- `RETICULUM_CONFIG_DIR`, `RETICULUM_INTERFACES` → `ingestor.reticulumConfigDir`,
  `ingestor.reticulumInterfaces`.
- Options typed `nullOr` emit no variable when left `null`, so the app keeps its
  own default.

## Docker

Docker images are published on GitHub Container Registry for each release.
Image names and tags follow the workflow format:
`${IMAGE_PREFIX}-${service}-${architecture}:${tag}` (see `.github/workflows/docker.yml`).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-web-linux-amd64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-web-linux-arm64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-web-linux-armv7:latest

docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-ingestor-linux-amd64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-ingestor-linux-arm64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-ingestor-linux-armv7:latest

docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-matrix-bridge-linux-amd64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-matrix-bridge-linux-arm64:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-matrix-bridge-linux-armv7:latest

# version-pinned examples
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-web-linux-amd64:v0.7.5
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-ingestor-linux-amd64:v0.7.5
docker pull ghcr.io/l5yth/potato-mesh-matrix-bridge-linux-amd64:v0.7.5
```

Note: `latest` is only published for non-prerelease versions. Pre-release tags
such as `-rc`, `-beta`, `-alpha`, or `-dev` are version-tagged only.

When using Compose, set `POTATOMESH_IMAGE_ARCH` in `docker-compose.yml` (or via
environment) so service images resolve to the correct architecture variant and
you avoid manual tag mistakes.

Feel free to run the [configure.sh](./configure.sh) script to set up your
environment. See the [Docker guide](DOCKER.md) for more details and custom
deployment instructions.

## Matrix Bridge

A matrix bridge is currently being worked on. It requests messages from a configured
potato-mesh instance and forwards it to a specified matrix channel; see
[matrix/README.md](./matrix/README.md).
