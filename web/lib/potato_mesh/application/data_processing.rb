# The submodules below all reopen +PotatoMesh::App::DataProcessing+ to
# contribute methods.  They are required in dependency order rather than
# alphabetically: +coercions+ and +identity+ define the canonical-id helpers
# that every higher-level submodule (messages, neighbors, telemetry, etc.)
# calls into, so they must load first.  Reordering the requires
# alphabetically would still load — Ruby resolves module method lookups at
# call time — but the explicit dependency order documents what each layer
# depends on without grepping.
