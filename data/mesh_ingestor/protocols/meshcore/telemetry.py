"""MeshCore telemetry collection (TI-A3).

MeshCore surfaces telemetry three ways: unsolicited/tag-matched
``TELEMETRY_RESPONSE`` events carrying a decoded CayenneLPP list,
``STATUS_RESPONSE`` events carrying battery/uptime gauges, and the host-only
``BATTERY`` event.  Other nodes' telemetry is **pull-only** (there is no
broadcast the library surfaces), so this module also provides the poll loop
that round-robins the contact roster with ``req_telemetry_sync`` — one on-air
request per :data:`~data.mesh_ingestor.config.MESHCORE_TELEMETRY_POLL_SECONDS`
— and reads the host radio's own battery/sensors over the local companion
link (no airtime).  Every reading is normalised into the canonical telemetry
packet shape and flows through the shared
:func:`~data.mesh_ingestor.handlers.store_telemetry_packet` pipeline with
``protocol="meshcore"``, preserving protocol parity (SPEC Invariant IV) and
the local-LoRa apex (Invariant I).
